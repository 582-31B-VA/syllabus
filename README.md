Absolute prerequisite: Dynamic Web Programming (582-21B-VA)

Continuing Education \
NWE.0F — Website Design Specialist

Teacher: Maxime Pigeon ([email](mailto:pigeonm@vaniercollege.qc.ca))

## Description

In this course, students are introduced to static types, as well as
system design principles used in back-end web programming. They learn
how to build robust web applications, how to handle errors, and continue
working with database management systems.

## Modality

The modality of this course is hybrid flexible. It will be conducted
synchronously both online and in person. Team classroom links will be
provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Outside of class periods, you can reach me through MIO at any time. On
weekdays, please allow 24 hours for me to respond.

## Pedagogical Approach

Classes will consist of a blend of lectures, live coding sessions, and
exercises. Readings, lecture notes and examples will be provided through
GitHub.

## Assessments

### Homework (10%)

Every class, time will be allocated for the completion of short homework
assignments directly tied to the learning material. Homework assignments
are meant to encourage continuous progress in acquiring the course
competencies. *Their content is not graded.* Students who submit the
assignment before next class will receive a perfect grade.

### Quizzes (2 × 5%)

Quizzes are similar in scope to homework assignments, but their content
is graded. They aim to assess students' understanding of one or two
concepts at most, and allow the teacher to provide rapid feedback.

### Project (20%)

The first assignment for this class aims to evaluate students' grasp of
a statically typed, compiled language. Students will need to translate a
previous project into this new language, ensuring they follow the new
syntax and conventions.

### LIA (3 × 20%)

Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed. The
LIA for this course involves developing a real web application. The
development process will be divided into three phases, each of which
will be graded separately.

#### Evaluation Criteria

-   Requirements are met.
-   Code is readable and consistently formatted.
-   Naming is descriptive and consistent.
-   Program flow is decomposed into manageable, logical pieces.
-   Common code is unified, and not duplicated.
-   APIs are used correctly.
-   HTML is semantic.
-   Documentation is correct and clear.

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues.

Accordingly, 10% of the total grade will be devoted to the assessment of
students' proficiency in the language of instruction. Variable and
function names will be assessed for consistency and correctness, while
comments will be assessed for accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late Submission Policy

Homework submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0.

For other types of submissions, no penalties will be applied if prior
arrangements were made with the teacher *before the submission
deadline*. However, if an assessment is submitted after the deadline
without prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will be applied to
the best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.
